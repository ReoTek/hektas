Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish biologist, physician, and physicist, introduced the principle of classification in botany and biology, establishing the binomial nomenclature method still used today. In his work, he classified plants at the genus level based on their flower structures. In his work Species Plantarum (The Species of Plants), he applied the binomial nomenclature method to around 6,000 plant species. In this section, a sculpture depicting Carl Linnaeus conducting research in his personal study, inspired by his working areas at the Linnaeus Garden established in Upsala, Sweden in 1655, is exhibited.
