American scientist Martin Chalfie is a biology professor at the University of Columbia. With a Ph.D. in neurobiology from Harvard University, Chalfie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008, along with Osuma Shimomura and Roger Y. Tsien. Their work focused on the discovery and development of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) naturally found in the jellyfish Aequorea Victoria. This research provided a wide range of opportunities for investigating biological processes at the molecular level. In this section, a sculpture inspired by a photograph featuring Chalfie and the illustration of the jellyfish Aequorea Victoria is exhibited.
