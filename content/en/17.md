Craig C. Mello is a biology professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, while Andrew Z. Fire is a biology professor specializing in pathology and medical sciences at Stanford University. They were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2006 for their groundbreaking research on RNA interference. This concept, also known as “gene silencing”, involves blocking the excessive production of mRNA and effectively neutralizing external factors such as viruses. It has significant applications in combating agricultural pests and diseases. In this section, sculptures inspired by photographs taken in Mello and Fire’s laboratories in the U.S., where they conducted most of their experiments using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, commonly known as the threadworm, are exhibited.
