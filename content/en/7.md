Gregor Mendel, the pioneer of genetics, was also a biologist, meteorologist, mathematician, and clergyman from Austria. Mendel studied seven features of pea plants: plant height, shape and color of the seed coat, seed shape, seed color, and flower position and color. In his pea experiments, Mendel used the terms ``recessive” and “dominant”. In this section, a sculpture representing Mendel is exhibited, depicting him conducting his famous experiments in the garden of the Augustinian St. Thomas Monastery in Brno.
