Thomas Hunt Morgan, an American zoologist and geneticist, developed the contemporary theory of heredity based on chromosomes through his experiments with fruit flies (Drosophila genus). His groundbreaking work earned him the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1933. Morgan conducted much of his research on species variation and evolution at Columbia University, where he established the “Fly Room” in 1911, focusing on the study of fruit fly genetics. In this section, a sculpture inspired by Morgan’s Fly Room is exhibited.
