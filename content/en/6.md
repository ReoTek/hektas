Louis Pasteur, a French microbiologist and chemist, conducted research on viral diseases such as anthrax, chicken cholera, and rabies, as well as immune mechanisms and vaccine preparation techniques. His work on bacteria contributed to the advancement of medicine. He discovered the role of microorganisms in fermentation and infectious diseases, leading to the development of pasteurization for food preservation. In this section, a sculpture inspired by a painting of Pasteur created by Albert Edelfelt in 1885 is exhibited.
