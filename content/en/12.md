Rosalind Elsie Franklin was a British biophysicist, chemist, and crystallographer. Her X-ray diffraction studies made significant contributions to the understanding of the structure of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite. Her contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely recognized after her death. The photograph known as “Photo 51” played a critical role in understanding the 3D structure of DNA. James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their work on DNA, although the scientific community acknowledges Franklin’s significant contributions as well. In this section, a sculpture inspired by photographs taken in Franklin’s laboratory is exhibited.
