American scientist James Watson is known for his research on the structure of DNA at the University of Cambridge. British molecular biologist, physicist, and neuroscientist Francis Crick, on the other hand, is known for his studies on human consciousness. The duo met at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge in 1951 and made a significant scientific success by elucidating the double helical structure of DNA in 1953. As a result of this achievement, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962. In this section, sculptures inspired by photographs of Watson and Crick with DNA double helix model in 1953 are exhibited.
