Alexander Fleming was the Scottish bacteriologist who discovered penicillin. While trying to put his cluttered laboratory in order, Fleming discovered an interesting colony of fungi and noticed that they were growing in containers surrounded by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. He realized that these fungi destroyed potentially harmful bacteria. In 1929, he published a paper describing his discovery, which he named Penicillin. In 1939, together with Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain, he completed the pharmacological and clinical studies of penicillin at the Oxford School and won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1945. The sculpture exhibited in this section is inspired by photographs of Alexander Fleming's laboratory in Paddington, London.
