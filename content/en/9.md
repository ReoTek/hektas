Marie Curie, a Polish-French physicist and chemist, conducted pioneering research in the field of radioactivity. Through her experiments with uranium, she discovered radioactivity. She identified the radioactive properties of thorium and isolated the element radium. Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911. Marie Curie’s discovery of radioactivity paved the way for Rosalind Franklin’s later imaging of DNA. In this section, a sculpture inspired by photographs of the laboratory in Paris where Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie worked is exhibited.
