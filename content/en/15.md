Turkish physician, academic, biochemist and molecular biologist Aziz Sancar was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research mapping how cells repair their damaged DNA and preserve their genetic information. The techniques he developed and named, such as the “maxicell technique” and his own invention, the “excinuclease/excision nuclease enzyme”, has been included in the Oxford University Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Dictionary. Sancar has been elected to the U.S. National Academy of Science. In this section, a sculpture inspired by a photograph taken at the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm, Sweden, where Aziz Sancar received his Nobel Prize, is exhibited.
