Robert Hooke, a British natural scientist, philosopher, architect, engineer, and scientist, had a particular interest in biology. In 1665, using his self-built microscope, he discovered empty chambers in dead fungal tissue. During his investigations, Robert Hooke named these chambers “cells” (cellula). In this section, a sculpture inspired by a painting created in 2011 by historical artist Rita Greer, depicting Hooke in his room at Oxford University, is exhibited.
