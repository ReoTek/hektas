Rachel Carson, an ecologically  friendly American scientist, initiated the global environmental movement and proved the harmful effects on the insecticide DDT with her book “Silent Spring”. She began her career as a biologist at the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries and later transitioned into a full-time nature writer in the 1950s. Her notable works include “The Sea Around Us” (1950), “The Edge of the Sea” (1955), “Silent Spring” (1962), and “The Sense of Wonder” (1965). In this section, a sculpture inspired by a photograph of Rachel Carson published in the Baltimore Sun Newspaper in 1954 is exhibited.
