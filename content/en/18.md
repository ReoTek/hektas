French microbiology professor Emmanuelle Charpentier and chemistry professor Jennifer Doudna from the University of California, Berkeley, were the first scientists to propose the use of CRISPR/Cas9 enzymes for genome editing in 2012. Their groundbreaking work led them to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020. The CRISPR/Cas9 technique is widely used in various fields such as disease treatments, protein research, insect studies, development of control strategies for pathogens and weeds, and improvement of crops. In this section, sculptures inspired by photographs taken of Charpentier and Doudna in the city of Oviedo, Spain, in 2015 are exhibited.
