title: Kary Banks MULLIS (1944-2019)
---

American biochemist Kary Banks Mullis, together with Michael Smith, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 for the discovery of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). PCR, a method for amplifying DNA, allows the replication of each strand of genetic material billions of times within hours. The PCR technique has revolutionized molecular biology and in every field of medicine. In this section, a sculpture inspired by Mullis’s TED talk titled “A Next-Gen Cure for Killer Infections” given on July 27, 2010, is exhibited.
